# Introduction to Aeterna

Aeterna is a **Universal Memory & Knowledge Framework** for AI agents — providing persistent, structured, multi-tenant memory across sessions, tools, and teams.

## What it solves

AI agents are stateless by default. Aeterna gives them:
- **7-layer memory hierarchy** — working memory through institutional knowledge
- **Git-based knowledge repository** — versioned ADRs, patterns, constraints
- **Enterprise governance** — multi-tenant RBAC with Cedar policies
- **Plug-in architecture** — swap storage backends, embedding models, and LLM providers
