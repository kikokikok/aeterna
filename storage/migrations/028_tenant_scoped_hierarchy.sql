-- 028_tenant_scoped_hierarchy.sql
--
-- Make the organizational hierarchy (companies / organizations / teams)
-- tenant-scoped by introducing `companies.tenant_id UUID REFERENCES
-- tenants(id)`. Rationale, blast-radius analysis, and backfill strategy
-- are documented at length in:
--
--   openspec/changes/harden-tenant-provisioning/
--     NOTES-hierarchy-migration-blast-radius.md
--
-- Summary of the problem this fixes:
--
--   Migration 009 created `companies` 8 migrations before the
--   `tenants` table existed, under the explicit assumption (see
--   009 line 8) that "each company is a separate tenant". That
--   made `companies.slug TEXT UNIQUE` a sensible global constraint.
--
--   Migration 017 introduced the real `tenants` table for
--   multi-tenant isolation but did not reconcile with 009.
--
--   `TenantManifest.hierarchy: Vec<ManifestCompany>` assumes a
--   single tenant can own arbitrarily many companies. That
--   contradicts the global `UNIQUE(slug)` constraint.
--
-- Resolution (decided 2026-04-22 22:16 UTC, option A):
--   Add `companies.tenant_id` as a cascading FK to `tenants(id)`
--   and swap `UNIQUE(slug)` for `UNIQUE(tenant_id, slug)`.
--
-- Transitively scoped (no schema change needed):
--   - organizations (via company_id -> companies.tenant_id)
--   - teams (via org_id -> organizations.company_id -> ...)
--   - projects (same chain)
--   - governance_roles / governance_configs / approval_workflows
--     (their scope-tuple columns point at companies/orgs/teams UUIDs)
--   - email_domain_patterns.company_id, git_remote_patterns.company_id
--
-- Not resolved here (tracked in blast-radius NOTES):
--   - email_domain_patterns.domain UNIQUE (global vs per-tenant)
--   - memberships / org_members / team_members apply from manifest
--     (deferred to §2.2-B5 follow-up)
--
-- Idempotency: this file must be runnable against a fresh DB and
-- against a DB where it has already been applied. Every statement
-- uses IF NOT EXISTS / IF EXISTS or a DO block that checks pg_*
-- catalog tables before acting.

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 1. Add tenant_id as nullable so the UPDATE below can populate it.
-- ============================================================================
ALTER TABLE companies
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 2. Backfill. Companies created before this migration were keyed only
-- by slug; match each to a tenant with the same slug. This is the invariant
-- bootstrap.rs + admin_sync.rs + commands/admin.rs now maintain after the
-- preceding "§2.2-B prereq" commit (36d2c51b) repaired their tenant-row
-- creation logic. Anything already populated (e.g. by a partial prior run)
-- is left alone.
-- ============================================================================
UPDATE companies c
   SET tenant_id = t.id
  FROM tenants t
 WHERE t.slug = c.slug
   AND c.tenant_id IS NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 3. Orphan abort. If any companies row has no matching tenants.slug,
-- we refuse to proceed. See blast-radius NOTES for the rationale against a
-- silent "migration-orphan" tenant (short version: silent reassignment in
-- prod is invisible data corruption). Operators facing this error should
-- either create the missing tenants rows or reassign the orphan companies
-- via manual SQL, then re-run the migration.
-- ============================================================================
DO $$
DECLARE
    orphan_count INT;
    orphan_slugs TEXT;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*), COALESCE(string_agg(slug, ', ' ORDER BY slug), '')
      INTO orphan_count, orphan_slugs
      FROM companies
     WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;

    IF orphan_count > 0 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION
            'Migration 028 aborted: % companies rows have no matching tenants.slug. Orphan slugs: [%]. Create the missing tenants rows (or reassign these companies) before re-running.',
            orphan_count, orphan_slugs;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 4. Lock tenant_id NOT NULL now that every row has a value.
-- Idempotent: SET NOT NULL on an already-NOT-NULL column is a no-op.
-- ============================================================================
ALTER TABLE companies
    ALTER COLUMN tenant_id SET NOT NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 5. Constraint surgery. `companies_slug_key` is the auto-named
-- constraint from `slug TEXT UNIQUE` in migration 009. Drop it and replace
-- with a tenant-scoped composite UNIQUE.
--
-- ADD CONSTRAINT does not support IF NOT EXISTS for UNIQUE in stable
-- Postgres (<= 16), so we guard with a catalog lookup to keep the migration
-- idempotent on repeat application.
-- ============================================================================
ALTER TABLE companies
    DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS companies_slug_key;

DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint
         WHERE conname = 'companies_tenant_slug_key'
           AND conrelid = 'companies'::regclass
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE companies
            ADD CONSTRAINT companies_tenant_slug_key UNIQUE (tenant_id, slug);
    END IF;
END $$;

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 6. Replace the old slug-only index with a tenant-scoped one.
-- The old index was `CREATE INDEX idx_companies_slug ON companies(slug)
-- WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` (migration 009).
-- ============================================================================
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_companies_slug;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_tenant_slug
    ON companies(tenant_id, slug)
    WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- Step 7. Rewrite views to surface tenant_id.
--
-- CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW would be preferred to preserve grants, but it
-- requires the replacement to have a compatible column list. We're adding
-- tenant_id as the first column, which changes the column sequence; that
-- is not a compatible change under Postgres's CREATE OR REPLACE rules.
-- DROP + CREATE is the only portable path.
--
-- No other views depend on v_hierarchy or v_user_permissions at time of
-- writing (verified via pg_depend on 009's post-migration state), so the
-- DROP has no cascading consequences. If a future migration adds a
-- dependent view, it must also DROP CASCADE when replacing these.
-- ============================================================================
