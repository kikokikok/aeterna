-- Migration 029: agents.tenant_id + v_agent_permissions relocation
--
-- Closes the second half of issue #130: agent-permissions isolation.
--
-- PR #131 added tenant-filtering to hierarchy and users endpoints in
-- opal-fetcher, but /v1/agents still returned the globally-merged agent
-- set across every tenant — because the `agents` table (migration 009)
-- has no `tenant_id` column. An agent's tenant was only knowable
-- transitively via `agents.allowed_company_ids -> companies.tenant_id`,
-- and that set can in principle span multiple tenants.
--
-- This migration establishes the invariant **one agent = one tenant**:
--
--   1. ADDs a nullable `agents.tenant_id UUID` column (FK -> tenants.id).
--   2. AUDITs existing agents for cross-tenant scope; ABORTs with a
--      loud RAISE if any agent's allowed_company_ids span multiple
--      tenants or if any active agent has no derivable tenant. This is
--      deliberate: we do not want to pick a tenant for you, because a
--      silent wrong choice would be a durable authz bug.
--   3. BACKFILLs tenant_id from the distinct tenant of
--      allowed_company_ids (plus fallback derivations through orgs /
--      teams / projects for agents scoped at finer granularities).
--   4. SETs NOT NULL once the backfill is complete.
--   5. RELOCATEs the `v_agent_permissions` view from
--      `idp-sync::github::initialize_opal_views` into this migration
--      (same pattern as migration 028 for v_hierarchy and
--      v_user_permissions), surfacing tenant_id as the first column.
--      Fixes a latent bug: the idp-sync definition referenced
--      `u.display_name`, which does not exist in the users table
--      (migration 009 defines `users.name`). The relocated view uses
--      `u.name` correctly.
--
-- Operational note: if step 2 aborts in staging/prod, the offending
-- agents need to be manually split or re-scoped before retrying. The
-- error message lists every problem agent id so the fix is mechanical.
--
-- Follow-up #130 subtask remaining after this migration: relocate
-- idp-sync writes from `organizational_units` to
-- `companies/organizations/teams`, then remove the legacy OU writes
-- from `PostgresBackend::initialize_schema`.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Add column (nullable initially for backfill)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

ALTER TABLE agents
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Audit: fail loud on cross-tenant agents
