## Purpose

The Admin Dashboard capability provides a browser-based administration interface for Aeterna platform operators and tenant administrators. It enables visual management of tenants, organizational hierarchies, users, roles, knowledge, memories, governance workflows, policies, drift detection, and system health through a single-page application served directly from the Aeterna server.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Admin UI Authentication
The admin dashboard SHALL authenticate users through the existing plugin_auth flow, adapting the GitHub OAuth exchange for browser-based sessions.

#### Scenario: User logs in via GitHub OAuth
- **WHEN** an unauthenticated user navigates to `/admin`
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL display a login page with a GitHub authentication option
- **AND** the login flow SHALL exchange a GitHub access token for Aeterna-issued JWT credentials via `POST /api/v1/auth/plugin/bootstrap`
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL store the access and refresh tokens for subsequent API requests

#### Scenario: Access token automatic refresh
- **WHEN** the stored access token is expired or within 60 seconds of expiry
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL automatically refresh the token via `POST /api/v1/auth/plugin/refresh`
- **AND** subsequent API requests SHALL use the refreshed token without user interaction

#### Scenario: Refresh token expired or revoked
- **WHEN** the refresh token is expired, revoked, or invalid
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL redirect the user to the login page
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL clear all stored tokens

#### Scenario: PlatformAdmin role detection
- **WHEN** a user authenticates and their resolved roles include a PlatformAdmin grant stored under the `__root__` sentinel tenant
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL display PlatformAdmin-only navigation items (tenant management, platform settings)
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL enable the cross-tenant selector in the header

### Requirement: Tenant Context Management
The admin dashboard SHALL support multi-tenant context switching for PlatformAdmin users and display the active tenant context for all users.

#### Scenario: Regular user sees own tenant context
- **WHEN** a non-PlatformAdmin user is authenticated
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL display the user's resolved tenant in the header
- **AND** all API calls SHALL include the user's tenant context from the JWT
- **AND** the tenant selector SHALL show only the user's own tenant memberships

#### Scenario: PlatformAdmin selects target tenant
- **WHEN** a PlatformAdmin user selects a different tenant from the searchable tenant selector
- **THEN** all subsequent API calls for tenant-scoped operations SHALL include the `X-Target-Tenant-ID` header with the selected tenant's identifier
- **AND** the dashboard header SHALL display the currently targeted tenant prominently

#### Scenario: PlatformAdmin clears tenant target
- **WHEN** a PlatformAdmin user clears the tenant target selection
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL revert to the user's default tenant context
- **AND** API calls SHALL no longer include the `X-Target-Tenant-ID` header

### Requirement: System Health Dashboard
The admin dashboard SHALL display real-time system health and operational statistics on the home page.

#### Scenario: Health status display
- **WHEN** a user navigates to the dashboard home page
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL fetch `GET /health` and `GET /ready` endpoints
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL display the overall system status and per-backend health (PostgreSQL, vector store, Redis)

#### Scenario: Health auto-refresh
- **WHEN** the dashboard home page is displayed
- **THEN** the health status SHALL automatically refresh at a configurable interval (default 30 seconds)
- **AND** status transitions (healthy → degraded, degraded → healthy) SHALL be visually highlighted

#### Scenario: Quick statistics display
- **WHEN** a user views the dashboard home page
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL display aggregate counts for tenants, users, memories, and knowledge items
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL show a count of pending governance requests with a direct link to the governance page

### Requirement: Tenant Lifecycle Management
The admin dashboard SHALL provide PlatformAdmin users with visual interfaces for tenant lifecycle operations.

- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL create the tenant via `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants`
- **AND** the new tenant SHALL appear in the tenant list upon successful creation

#### Scenario: Tenant detail management
- **WHEN** a PlatformAdmin user selects a tenant from the list
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL display a tabbed detail view with tabs for Overview, Domain Mappings, Repository Bindings, Configuration, Secrets, and Git Provider Connections

#### Scenario: Tenant configuration editing
- **WHEN** a user edits tenant configuration fields
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL display each field with its ownership (Platform vs Tenant) and allow editing of fields the user is authorized to modify
