# Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in the Memory-Knowledge System project. In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the project requires that a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") be on file from each Contributor.

This Agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the project.

1. Definitions.
   "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the project.
   "Contribution" shall mean any source code, object code, patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual, documentation, or any other work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the project.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the project and to recipients of software distributed by the project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the project and to recipients of software distributed by the project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the project, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the project.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
